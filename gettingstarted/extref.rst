As you will see exploring SparkER, there is a *big* and *heavy* theoretical background
with everything this library uses.
Since it would require a bit bit more than just few lines to explain every definition 
and action of SparkER, we will give you some references to articles published by developers 
and professors about the mathematical and algorithmical tools used here.
