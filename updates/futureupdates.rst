Upcoming Features
+++++++++++++++++

With the passing of times, things grow and evolve, and SparkER software
makes no exception.
Here is a list of what you can expect to be added or implemented in SparkER.

pip install
-----------

At the time of writing, SparkER hasn't been uploaded on PyPi,
but in the near future it will be possible to install SparkER using
the much known way of ``pip install SparkER``.

More wrappers
-------------

Even though SparkER implements wrappers for the most used data formats,
like ``csv`` or ``json``, there's still a ton of other formats that can be implemented
or might be requested by external users. So expect more options for this to be 
added.

Generalized Supervised Meta-Blocking
------------------------------------

At the time of writing, the necessary coding has already been implemented on SparkER,
but the paper for this still isn't released, so expect really soon an updated section of
the documentation on this new cool technique.


And more to come...
